        <p> I was born in Istanbul in 1999. I completed my primary and secondary school education in Ebussuud Primary School and my high school education in Gelenbevi Anatolian High School. 
                I still live in Istanbul. I started sales marketing in various sectors during the summer holidays since secondary school. 
                I started my education in Information Systems Engineering at Kocaeli University in 2017. 
                In September 2017, I founded a student club called MÃ¼hendis Beyinler and I am the chairman of this club.
                <p> There is a production prone to teamwork. I would also be happy to work with a team. Since I am an excited and curious person, I like to ask questions and do research. 
                It makes me happy to do research and learn new information on many topics, especially my interests. </p>
